# CodeBreakerText 🔐

A text-based logic game where players must guess the correct sequence of numbers.

## 📜 About the Project

CodeBreakerText is a simple yet engaging game that challenges players to decipher a hidden numeric code using logic and deduction.  With each attempt, the game provides feedback in the form of clues, indicating how close the player's guess is to the correct sequence. This feedback guides the player's reasoning and helps them refine their strategy as they work towards breaking the code.

## 🚀 Technologies Used

*   Python

## 🔧 How to Run the Project

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have JavaScript installed on your system.

### Steps to Run the Game

1.  Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/petersonchiquetto/CodeBreakerText.git](https://github.com/petersonchiquetto/CodeBreakerText.git)
cd CodeBreakerText
```

2.  Run the game script:

```bash
python main.py
```

## 🎮 How to Play

*   The game generates a secret numeric code (e.g., a sequence of digits).
*   Players enter a guess, and the game provides clues based on how close the guess is.  These clues might indicate the number of correctly placed digits and the number of correct digits in the wrong place.
*   Continue guessing and using the clues to deduce the secret code.
*   The game ends when the player correctly guesses the code.

## 📌 Future Improvements

*   🔹 Implement different difficulty levels (e.g., varying the length of the code or the range of digits).
*   🔹 Add a scoring system (e.g., based on the number of guesses taken).
*   🔹 Introduce a graphical interface (using a library like Pygame or Tkinter).
*   🔹 Add a timer or move limit.
*   🔹 Implement a "human vs. computer" mode where the computer tries to guess the player's code.
